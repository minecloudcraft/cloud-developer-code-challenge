# Project Notes

## Overview
This project provides Terraform configuration files to automate the provisioning of AWS resources for a game session workflow. If you already have the necessary AWS resources provisioned, you can use the provided Terraform files to set up additional resources or manage existing ones.

## Instructions
### Usage of Terraform Files
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the Terraform configuration files to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.

3. **Review Terraform Files**: Take a look at the initial Terraform files provided in the project:
   - `provider.tf`: Configures the AWS provider with the appropriate region.
   - `dynamodb.tf`: Defines the DynamoDB table required for storing game session data.
   - `step_function.tf`: Defines the AWS Step Function (Express) state machine for orchestrating the game session workflow.
   - `eventbridge.tf`: Sets up EventBridge rules to trigger the Step Function based on specific events.
   - `iam.tf`: Defines IAM policies and roles for resource access.
   - `outputs.tf`: Specifies output variables for retrieving resource identifiers.

4. **Customize Configuration (If Needed)**: If you need to customize any configurations, such as resource names or attributes, you can modify the respective Terraform files accordingly.

5. **Initialize Terraform**: Run `terraform init` in the project directory to initialize Terraform and download any necessary plugins.

6. **Review Terraform Plan**: Use `terraform plan` to review the proposed changes and ensure they align with your expectations. This step is optional but recommended to verify the planned actions.

7. **Apply Changes**: If you're satisfied with the Terraform plan, apply the changes by running `terraform apply`. Terraform will provision or update the specified resources based on the configuration files.

8. **Verify Resources**: After Terraform applies the changes, verify that the AWS resources are created or updated as expected by checking the AWS Management Console or using AWS CLI commands.

## Notes
- Ensure that you have appropriate AWS credentials configured on the machine where Terraform will be executed.
